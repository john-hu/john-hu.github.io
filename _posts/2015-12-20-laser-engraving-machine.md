This is my first laser engraving machine. I brought it from taobao with CNY 310. It's a small desktop version with 100 mW blue light laser. I have to admit that it is just a toy. It works pretty well. But the lifetime of laser head is short. So, after a few hours engraving, the laser head is so weak to engrave a new photo.

I had tried multiple materials, like paper, leather, wood, PLA, etc. My favored material is wood. I took my son's toy and engraved on it. This is my first work:
