It's not a typo. CUDAfy.net is an awesome library for C# programmer to write OpenCL code. As surveying OpenCL libraries, we found a good library for beginners. Since John Hu work with a junior programmer who can only program .net framework, we start to survey a tool to for a .net programmers. CUDAfy.net is the one. It translates .net framework bytecode to CUDA and OpenCL. We can use it to generate OpenCL source code from .net framework bytecode. That means you can write an OpenCL program in C#/VB.net. It's awesome. And the most awesome part is that CUDAfy.net is open sourced at [here](https://cudafy.codeplex.com/).

Let's see an very simple example. You may find the following code which calcualte the moving average in C#:

<figure>
    <img src="/images/opencl/cudafy-csharp.jpg" alt="the c# code for cudafy">
    <figcaption>the c# code for cudafy</figcaption>
</figure>

CUDAfy.net translate it to:

<figure>
    <img src="/images/opencl/cudafy-ocl.jpg" alt="the opencl code generated by cudafy">
    <figcaption>the opencl code generated by cudafy</figcaption>
</figure>
