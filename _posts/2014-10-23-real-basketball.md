 Are you playing Real Basketball? No matter yes or no, I am playing it. This is an [awesome game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mobilecraft.realbasketball). If you don't play it, you should try it. But I am not a good play honestly. So, I want to hire someone to swipe the phone for me. It sounds non-sense to hire a real person to do it for me. So, I wrote a small ShellScript to do that for me. I called it RealBasketballBot. You may find it at my github repo: [https://github.com/john-hu/RealBasketballBot](https://github.com/john-hu/RealBasketballBot). It's easy to use it: just plug the USB line and type the command `./throw_ball.sh 400 1280 400 600 0.2` . It works pretty well. BTW, you should install android USB driver if you use a Windows box.
