It is nice to have a talk at PyCon 2017 Taiwan. If you are around there, please come to join us. The talk held by John Hu is "OpenCLGA - Run Your GA on Top of PyOpenCL". It is about a new Genetic Algorithm implementation based on OpenCL. With OpenCL, OpenCLGA can run on top of all devices you have, including GPU, CPU, DSP, etc. We had also finished an example to run the GA across multiple computer with multiple computing devices, like Nvidia GPU, Intel GPU, Intel CPU, etc.

The URL of OpenCLGA is at [https://github.com/PyOCL/OpenCLGA](https://github.com/PyOCL/OpenCLGA).
