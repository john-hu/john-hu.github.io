The Kitkat for Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 had released at April 30th, 2014. We may find it at [http://samsung-updates.com/device/?id=GT-N5100](http://samsung-updates.com/device/?id=GT-N5100).

It almost has all languages in this ROM. After intalled, the device runs more smooth than before. Let's rock and roll.
