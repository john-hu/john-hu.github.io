## September 2015

I left mozilla at September 2015. It's a special adventure at the mozilla. I learned the mozilla's JavaScript coding styles, review rules, module owner/peer system, automation tests, tree tacking, and the most important open web culture. The best part at mozilla is to know a lot of talent engineer.

At mozilla, I did a small amount of jobs. The best retrospective is to see the Bugzilla statistics. It shows the works done during these 3 years:

1. 309 bugs, 0.5 bugs filed per day

2. 3366 comments, 5 comments made per day

3. 183 patches submitted, 0.25 patches submitted per day

4. 239 patches reviewed, 0.33 patches reviewed per day
